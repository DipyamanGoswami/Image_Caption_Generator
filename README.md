# Image_Caption_Generator

This Project deals with caption generation for images. It uses a pretrained model from hugging face to generate one caption per image. The generated caption is then feeded to the augmentation file to generate 10 different caption from that one caption. The main file has the routes for the pages and the html files contain the frontend. The index page takes in the image and feeds it to the respective files and the generated captions are displayed in the result page.
